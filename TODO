Todo
====

- Add more error cases to improve syntax error reporting.

- Write tests for each rule of semantic analysis, check that it behaves well on
  all cases that cause errors and warnings.

- Make sure errors are dealt with properly at each stage of the main function

- TODO: ideally, symbol lookup should be O(1) by creating new tables for
  each new scope

- Write language feature test cases in a unittest framework.

- Make sure all runtime variables can't clash with sire variables - rename all
  with underscores.



- Find out why asm expressions produce syntax errors, e.g. 
    .set .foo (_cp/4)+3


- Add a CompileStage class to record time and stats etc

- Adjust syntax to enforce array bounds for on statements, e.g. 
    proc foo(a[n], val n)

- Add NUMCORES keyword

- Constant pool (ideally) needs to be replicated amongst slaves.
