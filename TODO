Small
-----

- Fix: parser can easilly fall into infinite loop, e.g. with missing ';' or mimsing
  destination in asssignment.
- Add more error cases to improve syntax error reporting.
- Write tests for each rule of semantic analysis, check that it behaves well on
  all cases that cause errors and warnings.
- (Maybe?) Tidy up the AST tyes in class names by creating generic Decl/Param
  classes and switching on types internally.

Large
-----

- Write language feature test cases in a unittest framework.
